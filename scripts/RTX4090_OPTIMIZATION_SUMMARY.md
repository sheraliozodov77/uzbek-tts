## Memory Usage Estimation (ACTUAL)
- **Model Parameters**: ~83M parameters
- **Batch Size 64**: ~23.4GB VRAM usage (memory-optimized)
- **Safety Margin**: ~0.6GB free for system operations
- **Status**: Successfully trained without OOM errors

## Recommendations

### 1. Monitor GPU Usage
```bash
# Monitor GPU utilization
nvidia-smi -l 1

# Check memory usage
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

### 2. Start Training
```bash
# Start training with new configuration
python train_uzbek_tts.py --config config.yaml --data_dir ./data/preprocessed
```

### 3. If Memory Issues Occur (FINAL OPTIMIZATION)
- ✅ **FINAL**: batch_size = 64 (optimal for RTX 4090)
- ✅ **FINAL**: eval_batch_size = 16 (optimal for RTX 4090)
- ✅ **FINAL**: num_loader_workers = 6 (memory-optimized)
- If still having issues: reduce to batch_size = 48 or 32

### 4. Performance Monitoring
- Watch for OOM (Out of Memory) errors
- Monitor training loss convergence
- Check GPU utilization (should be >90%)
